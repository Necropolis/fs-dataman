Manage information in FamilySearch's reference cluster like it's Ruby on Rails test fixtures, only from a GEDCOM instead of a bazillion YAML files!

> Note that this is currently not finished, and represents a whole bunch of unfulfilled promises. If you want to help out, please do so. If it doesn't work for you, well, *tough*. You really should have read the non-indemnification bits of the license first.

# Requirements

- Apple Mac OS X 10.7 "Lion"
- Apple LLVM 3.0
- Apple Xcode 4.2 or better
